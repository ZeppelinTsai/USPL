I. Technical Concept Overview

This technology proposes a prompt optimization method for multi-table database structures, called the Unified Schema Prompt Layer (USPL).

The method consolidates fields from multiple tables into a unified semantic schema and annotates each field with its source table (`source_table`), whether it is a foreign key (`is_foreign_key`), and if so, the target table it refers to (`foreign_target_table`). This allows language models (e.g., GPT) to perform multi-table reasoning and SQL query generation as if processing a single-table structure.

This design addresses the difficulties language models face when dealing with structured data, multi-table joins, and automatic inference of JOIN conditions.

II. Key Technical Highlights

1. Compress multiple tables into a single unified semantic schema (JSON format)  
2. Annotate each field with source table and foreign key mapping  
3. Remove sample data, retain only field semantics and structure  
4. Follows language model-friendly input style to improve SQL inference accuracy  
5. Scalable to support any number of tables

III. Sample Schema (Simplified)

{
  "unified_schema": [
    {
      "column_name": "user_id",
      "source_table": "users",
      "is_primary_key": true
    },
    {
      "column_name": "order_id",
      "source_table": "orders",
      "is_primary_key": true
    },
    {
      "column_name": "user_id",
      "source_table": "orders",
      "is_foreign_key": true,
      "foreign_target_table": "users"
    }
  ]
}

IV. Use Cases and Technical Significance

This technology can be used in language model-assisted database query systems as a structured prompt guide, helping the model understand inter-table relationships and automatically infer SQL query logic (including JOIN conditions, query order, and column matching rules).

It requires no plugins or external tools—just structured prompt input—to significantly enhance the model’s comprehension of structured data and its query generation capabilities.

V. Background and Ownership

This method was independently developed by TSAI PEI LIN during non-working hours without the use of company resources. It is the result of personal research and design. This technology has never been used in any company project or demonstration. The initial concept and design were completed on April 1, 2025, and it is solely the author's original creation.
