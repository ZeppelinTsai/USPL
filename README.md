## 📘 Project Overview

**USPL** is a Python-based prototype system for querying structured data using natural language.  
Its core functionality includes:

- Generate SQL queries from user prompts and database schemas using GPT-3.5-turbo  
- Execute SQL and retrieve query results  
- Feed results back to GPT for natural language summarization  
- End-to-end simulation of realistic database fields and relationship logic

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

2. Run the main program:

```
python USPL.py
```

3. Check the outputs:
- SQL query generated by GPT  
- Executed query results  
- Natural language response

## 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```
pip install openai python-dotenv
```

- `openai`: GPT API integration  
- `python-dotenv`: Load environment variables  
- `sqlite3`: Built-in Python standard module
